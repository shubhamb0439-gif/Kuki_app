  # Fix To Be Paid Calculation to Include All Adjustments

  1. Changes to calculate_and_update_monthly_hours function
    - Now calculates deductions including:
      - Monthly loan deductions from active loans
      - Merit bonuses (positive adjustments)
      - Demerit penalties (negative adjustments)
      - Advance payments (positive adjustments)
      - Loan deduction bonuses (negative adjustments)
    
  2. Updated Logic
    - Base Wage: monthly_wage (full-time) OR hourly_rate Ã— actual_hours_worked (part-time)
    - Add: Merits + Advances
    - Subtract: Demerits + Monthly Loan Deductions + Loan Deduction Adjustments
    - Final Payable = Base + Merits + Advances - Demerits - Monthly Loan Deductions - Loan Deductions
    
  3. Purpose
    - Ensure "To Be Paid" reflects all financial adjustments
    - Include loan deductions, merits, demerits, and advances
    - Provide accurate payment calculations for both full-time and part-time employees
